            Who Hack Camp for?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Hack Camp is for high school students who want to create apps,
            build websites, and make games. Over two exhilerating weeks, you'll
            learn fundamental skills transferable to game and app development.
            We welcome girls and boys ages 14-18, no prior experience
            necessary.  Young adults with some experience are welcome as well,
            of course. Please bring your own laptop.
          </p>

          <h3 class="open-sans">
            How much does Hack Camp cost?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Hack Camp costs $595 for the two-week program. However, inclusivity
            is extremely important to us and we are readily offering full
            need-based financial aid (see the question on the application
            form).

            How many other students will be there?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Each session will vary in size between 4 and 12 campers. The
            student-mentor ratio will never exceed 4:1. For the specifics for a
            session, please contact us at
